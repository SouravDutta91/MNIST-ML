Neural nets on the MNIST dataset

All credits go to Dr. Jason Brownlee @ Machine Learning Mastery (https://machinelearningmastery.com/). I have just followed the code (https://machinelearningmastery.com/handwritten-digit-recognition-using-convolutional-neural-networks-python-keras/) in his website to learn about the different algorithms in Machine Learning and used them together to compare the accuracies of the various algorithms.
